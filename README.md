# SUMMARY

This is a fully java-based chess game developed using the native Java AWT library. Chess is difficult to develop based purely on its sophisticated logic (especially with searching for checkmate), but I decided to create a bigger challenge for myself and add GUI to it. Here is the final result.

# HOW TO INSTALL

``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/HaiderZak/chess.git

$ run chess.jar
```
